    <h3>Q2.Explain the difference between Absolute and Relative positioning</h3>
        <p> Ans:Relative: Moves the element from its original position, but still takes up space.
        
            Absolute: Places the element exactly where you want, based on the nearest positioned ancestor; it doesn't take up space in the layout.</p></p>
